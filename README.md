#### Project goals 
The aim of this project is to combine my passion for the trasportation industry and develop an application, which will serve me as a training ground for my skills. As time goes by, the application will be refactored and upgraded to reflect better software development practices and implement more complicated features.  
#### Tech stack
- DB: MSSQL, Azure SQL 
- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JS + SASS
- Backend: .NET 

Once a MVP is available, the app will be hosted on Azure; 

#### Project description
The Get My Ticket website aims to provide users with the possibility of booking trips, using a diverse type of transportation. Currently, the following 3 are supported: bus, airplane, train. 

#### Supported features (as of 28.04.2025)
- login and registration
- search for trips based on departure/arrival destination, start/end date or type of transportation
- update passenger data
- create booking & view current bookings
 
IMPORTANT NOTICE: This project aims to adhere to the best practices used in software development. However, this may not always be possible due to lack of resources that can be used free of charge.

Note about commits: I work on this project both at home on my personal laptop, as well as during my free time at work on my work laptop. Because of this, I aim to commit as often as needed to insure consistant codebase and prevent potential data loss, instead of when certain feature is complete.
