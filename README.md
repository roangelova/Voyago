#### Project goals 
The aim of this project is to combine my passion for the trasportation industry and develop an application, which will serve me as a training ground for my skills. As time goes by, the application will be refactored and upgraded to reflect better software development practices and implement more complicated features.  
#### Tech stack
DB: Azure SQL 
Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JS + SASS
Backend: .NET 

Once a MVP is available, the app will be hosted on Azure; 

#### Project description
The Get My Ticket website aims to provide users with the possibility of booking trips, using a diverse type of transportation. Currently, the following 3 are supported: bus, airplane, train. 
 
IMPORTANT NOTICE; This project aims to adhere to the best practices used in software development. However, this may not always be possible due to lack of resources. For example, at this stage of development, I have not found a SVG sprite provider offering social media logos that I can use FOC. Therefore, icons are used as a separate SVG file.
