#### Project goals 
The aim of this project is to combine my passion for the trasportation industry and develop an application, which will serve me as a training ground for my skills. As time goes by, the application will be refactored and upgraded to reflect better software development practices and implement more complicated features.  
#### Tech stack
- DB & Storage: MSSQL, Azure SQL , Redis
- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JS + SASS
- Backend: .NET

  Additional: Axios, TanStack Query, react-leaflet

#### Project description
The VOYAGO website aims to provide users with a platform for booking trips, using a diverse type of transportation. Currently, the following 3 are supported: bus, airplane, train. 

#### Supported features (as of 07.07.2025)
- User login and registration. We have now simplified our registration process - a user needs just an email and a password to get started. 
- Search for trips based on departure/arrival destination, start/end date or type of transportation. Also possible to choose type (adult, child or infant) and count of passengers for each search. Seperate tabs for searching by type of transportation available in the navigation bar. 
- Update passenger data (add, edit or delete passenger). One passenger is the account owner. 
- View cart. Add different baggage sizes based on the transportation provider's price list. Select from available passengers or add new ones for the booking. Finally, use a discount code if applicable and finish booking. The price is updated dynamically for full transparency. 
- View and manage current bookings from the account dashboard. Filter by status (canceled, confirmed) and sort by booking date (descending/ascending). 
- View booking details (trip data, passengers, baggage details, price summary), cancel booking and/or download a PDF borading pass.

 
IMPORTANT NOTICE: This project aims to adhere to the best practices used in software development. However, this may not always be possible due to lack of resources that can be used free of charge.

Note about commits: I work on this project both at home on my personal laptop, as well as during my free time at work on my work laptop. Because of this, I aim to commit as often as needed to insure consistant codebase and prevent potential data loss, instead of when certain feature is complete.
