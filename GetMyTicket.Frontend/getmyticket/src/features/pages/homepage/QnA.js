            <h4>Can I cancel or change my ticket after booking?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes, but cancellation and change policies vary depending on the
              transport provider. Please check the specific terms on your ticket
              details or contact our support team for assistance.

              Do I need to print my ticket, or can I use a mobile version?
            </h4>
            <p>
              In most cases, a mobile ticket is accepted. However, some
              providers may require a printed ticket, especially for trains and
              buses. Check your confirmation email for specific instructions.

            <h4>What should I do if I miss my bus/train/flight?</h4>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, most transport providers do not offer refunds for
              missed departures. We recommend arriving at the departure point at
              least 30â€“60 minutes early. If you do miss your trip, contact our
              support to explore your options.

            <h4>Are there discounts for children, students, or seniors?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes, many transport providers offer discounted fares for children,
              students, and seniors. During booking, select the appropriate
              passenger type to see if discounts apply.

              email and/or SMS, depending on your preferences. You can also

              What happens if my trip is delayed or canceled due to bad weather?
            </h4>
            <p>
              In case of delays or cancellations due to severe weather
              conditions, we follow the policy of the respective transport
              provider. You will be notified by email or SMS about any changes.
              If the trip is canceled, you may be eligible for a full refund or
              a free rebooking. Please contact our support team for assistance.
